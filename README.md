### Objectives for New System Implementation:
The objective of this system update is to improve the operation of their in-house call management. This overall will adjust the amount of calls that can be taken as well as how quickly they can be resolved. Another use case of this will improve the sales on holiday packages. Overall achieving these objectives will further. There will need to be an analysis on how many use cases there are in regard to the new system and how many of them will be new and vital over the current system. Our goal will be to design and build an agile scalable system to allow for a lot of room for the system to cope in the event of a large back up of calls. The overall goal is to filter customers to the best fitted Relationship Manager (RM). This will further enhance the efficiency of how each RM can assign a customer with their holiday packages. An improvement of this will then lead to a lot of wasted time being used efficiently as there will be less time needed to sort and filter customers or to even randomly assign the customer to a different RM every time.

### Stakeholders: 
When assessing the stakeholders that are needed to take into consideration with the implementation of such a large system-based project, we broke our findings down to identifying stakeholders into two different groups. These groups are internal stakeholders and external stakeholders.

| Internal Stakeholders| External Stakeholders |
|----------------------|-----------------------|
|Employees managing the calls in the call centre | End customers |
|Analytics managers|Public who display interests|
|Project managers |Hotels and other accommodation companies within the holiday packages|
|Relationship Managers |Hire companies eg cars, boats, bikes etc|
|Other branches of the company â€“ Relationship managers and call centre (CMC) |The Third-party travel related companies|
|generalised employees with the company ||
|HR dealing with internal disputes in the duration of the project  ||
|Share holders (though there is a difference, shareholders may still be classified as a stakeholder in this instance)||
